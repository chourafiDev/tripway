# Trip Way
Trip Way is a mobile application which allows users to book rides, choose drivers, and make payments through Stripe. The app was built using React Native and TailwindCSS for styling, integrated with Google Maps for managing directions, and PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon) for database management. I implemented user authentication using Clerk, ensuring a secure and seamless experience for both passengers and drivers.

## Features

- **Destination Selection:** Users can input and choose their desired destination for the ride.
- **Driver Selection:** Users can view available drivers and select the one they prefer for their trip.
- **Ride Booking:** Users can book a ride through an easy-to-use interface and secure the ride details.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment is handled through Stripe, allowing users to complete transactions seamlessly.
- **Authentication with Clerk:** Users are authenticated securely using Clerk, ensuring safe and verified access to the app.
